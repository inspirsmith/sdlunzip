Planning to use `requests` for making web API calls and looking for a way to handle OAuth2's client credential workflow? `ccflow` simplifies that process by extending the `requests` native model for [adding new forms of authentication](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/authentication/#new-forms-of-authentication) to support OAuth2's client credential workflow.
