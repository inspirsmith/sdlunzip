Intel server system debug log files are contained in zip files generated by the BMC. This holds
true for legacy BMC firmware as well as OpenBMC firmware. Those zip files come in multiple
"flavors" including password protected, bundled (zip files within zip files), or just plain
vanilla zip files.  This library simplifies the process of extracting log file content from the
variety of log zip files found in the wild.

```python
>>> import zipfile
>>> import sdlunzip
>>> zip = zipfile.ZipFile("./tests/data/legacy_log_1.zip")
>>> if t := sdlunzip.get(zip):
...     print(t)
...

                color: black;
                font-family: sans-serif;
                font-size:12px;
            }
```
